```

## Component Standards
- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Implement proper loading states and error boundaries
- Follow accessibility guidelines (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Use CSS modules or Tailwind for styling

## File Upload Guidelines
- Validate file types and sizes on both client and server
- Generate and store thumbnails for optimal performance
- Implement proper error handling and progress indicators
- Clean up temporary files and failed uploads

## Gallery Management
- Use optimistic updates for better UX
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Handle offline scenarios gracefully
- Maintain consistent grid layouts

## Security Practices
- Validate all file uploads
- Implement rate limiting on API routes
- Use secure URL generation for sharing
- Sanitize user inputs
- Implement proper CORS policies

## Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Create integration tests for API routes
- Implement E2E tests for critical user flows
- Test responsive layouts and mobile interactions
